## Overview

Zettel is a lightweight, file-based note-taking system inspired by the Zettelkasten method. It allows users to quickly create, link, tag, and archive notes from the command line, with a focus on bidirectional linking and deterministic note IDs.

## Summary of Contributions

### **Code Contributions**
- Implemented the **`Zettel` class**, which manages the overall repository of notes, providing methods for creating, listing, deleting, and retrieving notes.
- Implemented the **`Note` class**, encapsulating the structure and properties of a single note, including title, body, ID, and metadata.
- Developed the **`HelpCommand`**, allowing users to view a full list of available commands and their descriptions.
- Added corresponding support in the **`UI`** and **`Parser`** classes to integrate the help feature cleanly into the command flow.
- Ensured the help output dynamically reflects the full range of supported commands, improving usability and discoverability.
